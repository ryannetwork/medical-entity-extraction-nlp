        Note: In the above code snippet, I was getting Error "RuntimeError: Trying to backward through the graph a 
        second time, but the buffers have already been freed. Specify retain_graph=True when calling backward the 
        first time." - possibly because I have declared "self.usage" variable during the initialization, and now in 
        the first iteration of backpropogation, the program will run normally and will delete the newly constructed 
        graph after that. However, in the next iteration, it will construct the graph again, and will not find the 
        initialization in the graph, because the previous graph having the initialization operation was deleted 
        (as explained here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55268726/pytorch-why-does-preallocating-memory-cause-trying-to-backward-through-the-gr).
        One solution is to nable "specify retain_graph=True" in the backward() function. However, this stores all the 
        graph of the previous iterations and therefore, each succeding iteration will take more time to execute as well 
        as there will be significant overhead. Therefore, instead of initializing, I an going to pass the previous values 
        in the form of arguments of the function and will return the new values from the function, to maintain the graph.
